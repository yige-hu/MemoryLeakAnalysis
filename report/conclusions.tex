\section{Conclusions}

We have implemented a memory leak detection based on a Dataflow algorithm using 
a work-list, which is proposed by Orlovich and Rugina~\cite{rugina}. The analysis 
starts a backward Dataflow for each probe statements to disprove its negation. 
A set of six categories of microbenchmarks are tested to show the correctness 
of the implementation. We have also examined two GNU C library programs with no 
false positive. Due to the time constraint, the implementation only completes 
the intra-procedural analysis. Also, not enough middle- or large-scale C 
programs have been tested as benchmarks.
